## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Copy the clone repo link and create a map on your desktop with 'git clone <url>'

```

```
After that, go into the root folder and hit <npm install> to get all the project dependencies.

```

```
When you have installed all dependencies you can open up 2 separate terminals in the root folder.
In the first one you can write <npm run server> to start the API server. 
In the second one you can write <npm run client> to start the client server. 
```

```
You can now use the the slack-clone on your local machine with 2 different browser.
